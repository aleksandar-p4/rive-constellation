A React runtime library for [Rive](https://rive.app).

This library is a wrapper around the [JS/Wasm runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm), giving full control over the js runtime while providing components and hooks for React applications.

## Installation

Install through npm:

```
npm install --save qwik-rive
```

## Usage

```js
import { component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { QwikRive, Options } from 'qwik-rive';

export default component$(() => {
  const store = useStore<Options>({
      src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
  });
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <QwikRive options={store}></QwikRive>
      </div>
    </>
  );
});

```

## Rive Overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations anywhere. Designers and developers use our collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Our lightweight open-source runtime libraries allow them to load their animations into apps, games, and websites.
